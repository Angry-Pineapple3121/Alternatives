# Alternatives

## This is a place where alternatives to poorly made Minecraft mods/clients (and Chachy) can be stored together.

This is not final and may be discontinued. I got tired of having to watch 5/6 different repos and thought this would be easier. It should also make it easier for contributors as they can just make one PR instead of having to fork everything when a mod updates or whatever. Feedback is appreciated.

Ping me on discord at Microcontrollers#6733 or create an issue in the issues tab and let me know your thoughts.
